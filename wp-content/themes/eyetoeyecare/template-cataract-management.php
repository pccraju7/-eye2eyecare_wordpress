                    If your vision is starting to feel cloudy, blurry, or dim—even with glasses—you may be experiencing the early signs of cataracts. Cataracts are a natural part of aging, but the good news is that they can be effectively treated. Our cataract management services are designed to monitor your eye health, preserve your vision, and guide you through treatment options when the time is right.

                            A cataract occurs when the natural lens inside your eye becomes cloudy, making it harder to see clearly. This clouding can happen slowly over time and may affect one or both eyes. You may notice trouble with night vision, increased glare from lights, or colors looking faded or dull. Cataracts are very common, especially in people over age 60—but they are also very treatable.

                           Cataract management starts with regular comprehensive eye exams. During these visits, we’ll evaluate the clarity of your natural lens, monitor how cataracts are progressing, and assess how much they’re affecting your daily life. In the early stages, stronger glasses, better lighting, and anti-glare lenses may help improve your vision.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When cataracts begin to interfere with your ability to read, drive, or enjoy everyday activities, it may be time to consider surgery. Cataract surgery is a safe and highly successful outpatient procedure that replaces the cloudy lens with a clear artificial lens, restoring your vision.

                          If you’re noticing changes in your vision, especially increased glare, halos around lights, blurry distance vision, or difficulty with night driving, it’s a good time to schedule an exam. Early evaluation allows us to track the development of cataracts and plan for surgery when it becomes necessary.
